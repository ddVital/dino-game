# Dino-game

The Dinosaur Game (also known as the Chrome Dino) is a browser game developed by Google and built into the Google Chrome web browser that I recreated to practice and improve my skills. The player guides a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score.

# how to play?

Pressing `space`, or `tapping` the dinosaur on mobile devices will cause the dinosaur to "jump". As the game progresses, the speed of play gradually increases until the user hits an obstacle, prompting an instant.
